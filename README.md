'Node.js Persistant JSON' Storage

npJSON is an extremely simple KV data store without the weight of a traditional database (SQL or noSQL). It only provides methods for setting, retrieving, and updating data. This is not suitable for all applications, but it works well for simple applications that don't require a more robust KV store.

Data is stored as a JSON object in a customizable file.
